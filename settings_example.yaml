    # Folders with music for LyricManager to process
    paths_to_process:

    # Any folders added here will be excluded from processing. Mainly useful for recursive parsing.

    # LyricManager generates an abundance of files during processing.
    # A working directory is required and is - by default - located in a sub-folder where LyricManager is located.

    # The 'final' lyric alignment file (with extension .aligned_lyrics) LyricManager produces, can be copied alongside
    # the original audio file, into a wholly separate directory, or not copied anywhere at all.

    path_to_output_aligned_lyrics:

    # LyricManager supports two ways to output aligned lyrics:
    #   - Compact:  Few spaces, few line breaks, no tabs. Intended for low disk space consumtion.
    #   - Readable: Indentation, lots of spaces and line breaks. Intended for readability and debugging.
    #aligned_lyrics_output_mode: Compact
    aligned_lyrics_output_mode: Readable
    
  # TODO: In a future version, it may be worth-while to provide a series of processing settings to determine whether
  # new sources of information should be fetched/generated, or whether to re-use existing ones.
  # For now, LyricManager applies very rudamentary logic to attempt to highlight files which are likely flawed, and
  # should be removed by the user to re-acquire or re-generate them.
