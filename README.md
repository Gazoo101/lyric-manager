# Work-in-progress Warning

This tool is being *heavily* re-written and does not function as intended currently.

# Lyric Manager

Lyric Manager's primary function is support automatic song and lyric aligment. Specifically, given an .mp3 file Lyric Manager will query various lyric sources including, but not limited to:

- Local .txt files
- Remote lyric databases

to obtain the songs lyrics. Using the song.mp3 file and song.txt lyric file, Lyric Manager will use these files in conjunction with a lyric aligner. For now, Lyric Manager only utilises NUSAutoLyrixAlign and is optimized for its output. However, the framework is supportive of other alignment tools as needed.

# Requirements

- Python 3.7+ (due to its reliance on dataclass)
- Ubuntu 20.04 for Gui (due to reliance on Qt6)

# Input / Output

Lyric Manager uses the following input/output files, for a given `song.mp3`:

Input / Output | filename | Description
-------------- | -------- | -------------
Input | `song.mp3` | The audio to which the lyrics should be aligned. Provided by you.
Input | `song.txt` | Text file containing lyrics for `song.mp3`, provided by you. Set `LocalFile` in `lyric_fetchers` in `settings.yaml` to use this source.
Output | `song.genius` | If `lyric_fetchers` in `settings.yaml` includes `Genius` Lyric Manager will attempt to retrieve lyrics from the Genius database and generate this intermediate file.
Output | `song.lyrics_sanitized` | A sanitized version of the `song.txt` or `song.genius` removing non-lyric text and converting the lyrics to be more paletable for NUSAutoLyrixAlign.
Output | `song.nusalaoffline` | The alignment data generated by the offline version of NUSAutoLyrixAlign.
Output | `song.aligned_lyrics` | Contains JSON data with timing data and supporting rendering information as detailed below.

Example contents of `song.aligned_lyrics`:

```json5
{
    // Commentary inserted for clarity (not present in actual output!)
    "schema_version": "2.0.0", // A schema version to better track improvements / breakage
    "lyric_lines": [
        // lyric_lines typically contains multiple entries, one per line in the original lyric text.
        // Lyric Manager retains the lyric format structure (i.e. which words are in which lines)
        // from the original lyrics.
        // This example includes just a single entry.

                    "original": "flowing,",         // Original text of single lyric word - note the presence of the "," character
                    "single": "flowing",            // More presentable 'single word version' without the "," character
                    "word_split_char_pre": " ",
                    "word_split_char_post": "",
                    "time_start": 109.8,

# Limitations

Lyric Manager has a number of known limitations:

- Lyric Manager expects a specific song filenaming convention is expected: "<artist> - <songname>.mp3" (or other audio extension)
- Lyric Manager only supports a single lyric aligner (for now), i.e. NUSAutoLyrixAlign offline (found here: https://github.com/chitralekha18/AutoLyrixAlign)
    - In the meantime, you can use the online version of NUSAutoLyrixAlign (found here: https://autolyrixalign.hltnus.org/) and rename the output (for Audacity - selected in their online tool) to be the offline extension, e.g. `song.nusalaoffline`
- Lyric Manager only supports fetching lyrics from one lyric database or a manually provided file


# FAQ

I'm getting the error "version `GLIBC_2.28' not found"!

This will occur on Ubuntu 18.04, as Qt6 requires Ubuntu 20.04.
